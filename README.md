# Scintillators
Code for processing Cosmic Ray scintillator data for HGCAL Upgrade to CMS

peCalc2 options:

-f, --file : input file path. File should be produced using https://github.com/ChristopherRSettles/DRS4-Data-Analysis-Interface.
-s, --startPulse: for manual detection of the beginning of the signal pulse
-e --endPulse: for manual detenction of the end of the signal pulse
-g, --gainScale: multiplier on the converstion factor. Mostly unused. Its easier to manually update the conversion factor that is hard-coded.
-d, --display: creates plot to manually detect the pulse area (use alone, will stop program after producing the plot)
-peaks, --peaks: used with Low-Light (i.e., calibration) files. You may need to manually adjust the limits of the fit functions.
-A, --AutoPulse: automatically sets -s and -e based on the average pulse shape.

The output of the program is any one or more of the following:
A ROOT file named "<inputFileName>_analysed.root" that contains various histograms created (some may not be included based on which options were used above:
A histogram of the pedestal.
A histogram of the pedestal subtracted signal.
A histogram of the PE count for all events.
A histogram of the PE count for events that did not saturate the DRS4 and have more than half a PE.

In addition to the ROOT file, several .PNGs will be made:
A scatter plot of time vs. signal, for all events.
A histogram plot of PE counts for all events, with vertical lines showing the limits of the truncated mean calculation.

Finally, the most valuable output is written directly to terminal:
The number of events recorded.
The number of events used (i.e, events that did not saturate the DRS4 and have more than half a PE)
The range that the signal was found to be in (repeats input if -s and -e were used, or tells us the values found if -A was used.)
The mean and standard deviation (and their errors) of the PE count (Used) histogram.
The truncated mean and standard deviation (and their errors) of the PE count (Used) histogram.
Repeats this information in a single line for copying into a spreadsheet program.
